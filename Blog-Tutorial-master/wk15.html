            <h2 class="titleText">WK 15</h2>
            <p class="title-text">
                During week 15, I devoted considerable effort to advancing the front-end development of our project,
                particularly focusing on crafting a comprehensive user profile feature within the attendance page. This
                endeavor centered around designing a visually appealing ID card template that would allow administrators
                to access a wealth of information about each user with just a click.
                <br><br>
                Throughout this process, I immersed myself in the intricacies of the codebase, gradually gaining a
                deeper understanding of its workings. It became apparent that certain practices I had previously relied
                on, such as manually managing database connections and cursors, were unnecessary within this context.
                Moreover, I came to appreciate the importance of promptly committing changes to the database after each
                insertion—an approach that deviated from my past experiences with MSSQL.
                <br><br>
                As I navigated these disparities in practices, I encountered various errors and bugs that tested my
                problem-solving skills. Among these challenges was the task of rectifying the rotation mechanism for the
                profile ID cards. Initially, I encountered difficulties in ensuring smooth rotation from the front to
                the back of the card upon hovering the cursor. However, with perseverance and meticulous debugging
                efforts, I successfully resolved these issues.
                <br><br>
                With the rotation mechanism in place, hovering over the front of the ID card triggers a seamless
                transition to reveal the back, showcasing additional details such as the employee's bio, employee ID
                number, department, and the date of issue. Additionally, I incorporated social media links—such as
                GitHub and LinkedIn—on the back of the card, allowing administrators to explore each user's online
                profile.
                <br><br>
                Now, armed with a comprehensive user profile feature, I am poised to enhance the user experience within
                the attendance page significantly. Administrators will gain convenient access to a wealth of information
                about each user, including profile pictures, biographical details, and relevant social media links. This
                improvement not only streamlines administrative tasks but also fosters a more interactive and engaging
                platform for users.
