            <p class="title-text">

                As the final week of the PFD project unfolded, excitement crackled in the air. Our tireless efforts
                finally bore fruit: OpenCV successfully compared images, identifying individuals! This pivotal moment, a
                testament to our grit and determination, was quickly replaced by the looming deadlines of Week 15.
                Completing the project within the shrinking timeline and ensuring seamless collaboration felt daunting,
                but we pivoted swiftly. Prioritization became our mantra, every action guided by the unifying goal of
                perfect harmony between components.
                <br><br>
                My personal front-end journey mirrored this collective effort. The ID card remained unfinished, plagued
                by alignment issues and a picture display fiasco. Refusing to back down, I sought aid from trusted
                friends, and together we conquered the challenge. But the quest didn't end there. A crucial employee
                table demanded creation, showcasing attendance streaks, missed days, and detailed daily check-ins. This
                intricate task required meticulous attention to detail and strict adherence to project specifications.
                <br><br>
                Our path wasn't paved with roses. Presenting attendance data on an HTML page proved trickier than
                anticipated. Unfamiliarity with concepts like rows, arrays, and Flask initially threw us off balance.
                Yet, fueled by an unwavering dedication to continuous learning and problem-solving, we emerged
                triumphant. This was a true reflection of our team's resilience, forged in the fires of each obstacle
                overcome.
                <br><br>
                Bugs, sneaky and ever-present, lurked throughout the project. Just like the extraneous code lurking in
                the HTML page, sabotaging the login function, they threatened to derail our progress. But by leveraging
                our honed troubleshooting skills, we met each challenge head-on, ensuring the system's smooth operation.
                <br><br>
                Looking back, the PFD experience stands as a beacon of growth and challenge. It was a platform for
                exploring new technologies, grappling with intricate problems, and acquiring invaluable skills. The
                inherent difficulties did not deter us; instead, they left a lasting impression, transforming us into a
                resilient team brimming with knowledge. As the final week draws to a close, we stand united, having
                conquered every hurdle and built a project that speaks volumes about our dedication and collaborative
                spirit.
