                <p class="post-description">In Week 2, our team maintained continuity with the project's initial vision,
                    adapting to the
                    unavailability of a dedicated camera by using laptop or phone cameras temporarily. We established a
                    Git
                    repository for version control and collaborative efficiency.
                    <br><br> As the Front-End Developer, my focus was on creating a foundational HTML website using
                    laptop
                    cameras
                    for image capture. Simultaneously, I delved into extensive research on design aspects, including
                    aesthetic elements, color schemes, and user-friendly features. This thorough exploration ensures our
                    website is not only functional but also visually appealing and intuitive.
                    <br><br>
                    Moving forward, our team is poised for strategic enhancements based on the initial setup. The Git
                    repository will facilitate seamless collaboration, supporting our progress through project stages.
                    The
                    synergy between research, HTML implementation, and ongoing collaboration sets a solid foundation for
                    the
                    success of our Facial Recognition Attendance Taking System, emphasizing our commitment to delivering
                    a
                    robust, aesthetically pleasing, and user-friendly solution.

                <p class="post-description">In Week 3, as the Front-End Developer for FRATS website development, I
                    focused
                    on creating a visually appealing
                    and user-friendly interface. For the homepage, I crafted a clean design in line with FRATS'
                    identity,
                    utilizing
                    a white space background and the primary color, Purple. The main page design prioritized a seamless
                    and
                    intuitive user experience for capturing and uploading attendance photos. Additionally, I designed a
                    logo
                    featuring a human figure with a fingerprint, symbolizing our biometric focus and security
                    commitment.
                    FRATS aims
                    to offer a contactless, scalable, and affordable AI-powered attendance system. In the coming weeks,
                    I'll
                    continue refining the website's front-end for an enhanced user experience, sharing updates on
                    challenges

                <p class="post-description">In Week 4 of FRATS development, my primary focus was on enabling image
                    uploads
                    to the SQLite database
                    for OpenCV use. I enhanced functionality with a new "upload" button and user data entry.
                    Dissatisfied with the light theme, I revamped the interface with a full black background, a
                    red-orange color scheme, and a contrasting blue-purplish theme.

                    A challenge involves manual image insertion; the goal is seamless automation for a better user
                    experience and data integrity.

                    Moving forward, my focus is resolving this challenge, aiming for direct image insertion into the
                    SQLite database through Flask. Success will pave the way for integrating OpenCV into the FRATS
                    website, a crucial step in achieving project goals.

                    Throughout development, I am committed to providing detailed explanations, ensuring clarity in
                    database functionality integration and preparing for OpenCV incorporation into the FRATS website.

                <p class="post-description">In Week 5 of FRATS development, significant progress was made, focusing on
                    crucial functionalities and
                    overcoming challenges. The first day addressed frontend challenges, enhancing responsiveness, and
                    resolving popup confirmation issues. Simultaneously, we successfully tackled image insertion into
                    the
                    SQLite3 database.
                    <br><br>
                    Over the next two days, efforts shifted to optimizing website responsiveness for various devices,
                    ensuring a seamless user experience. We expanded system capabilities by developing a signup and
                    login
                    system.
                    Challenges included communication gaps with Flask for the backend, requiring adjustments to HTML/CSS
                    code. Looking ahead, tasks include consolidating databases, implementing a notification system, and
                    addressing the "Forgot Password" feature.
                    <br><br>
                    The team remains dedicated to a meticulous approach, ensuring seamless integration of all FRATS
                    website
                    components. Valuable learning experiences from challenges underscore the collaborative effort
