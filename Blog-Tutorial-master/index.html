                <p class="post-description">In Week 2, our team maintained continuity with the project's initial
                    vision,
                    adapting to the
                    unavailability of a dedicated camera by using laptop or phone cameras temporarily. We
                    established a
                    Git
                    repository for version control and collaborative efficiency.
                    <br><br> As the Front-End Developer, my focus was on creating a foundational HTML website using
                    laptop
                    cameras
                    for image capture. Simultaneously, I delved into extensive research on design aspects, including
                    aesthetic elements, color schemes, and user-friendly features. This thorough exploration ensures
                    our
                    website is not only functional but also visually appealing and intuitive.
                    <br><br>
                    Moving forward, our team is poised for strategic enhancements based on the initial setup. The
                    Git
                    repository will facilitate seamless collaboration, supporting our progress through project
                    stages.
                    The
                    synergy between research, HTML implementation, and ongoing collaboration sets a solid foundation
                    for

                    focused
                    on creating a visually appealing
                    and user-friendly interface. For the homepage, I crafted a clean design in line with FRATS'
                    identity,
                    utilizing
                    a white space background and the primary color, Purple. The main page design prioritized a
                    seamless
                    and
                    intuitive user experience for capturing and uploading attendance photos. Additionally, I
                    designed a
                    logo
                    featuring a human figure with a fingerprint, symbolizing our biometric focus and security
                    commitment.
                    FRATS aims
                    to offer a contactless, scalable, and affordable AI-powered attendance system. In the coming

                    introducing a
                    new "upload" button and refining user data entry. Dissatisfied with the light theme, I revamped the
                    interface with a sleek black background, a dynamic red-orange color scheme, and an accentuating
                    blue-purplish theme.
                    <br><br>
                    A persistent challenge involves manual image insertion, prompting a renewed commitment to achieving
                    seamless automation for an enhanced user experience and data integrity.
                    <br><br>
                    Moving forward, my development focus will be on addressing this challenge directly, aiming for
                    streamlined automation of image insertion into the SQLite database. Success in this endeavor will be
                    a
                    significant step towards integrating OpenCV into the FRATS website, a crucial milestone in achieving
                    project goals.
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout the ongoing development phase, my commitment remains unwavering in providing detailed
                    explanations, ensuring clarity in the integration of database functionalities, and preparing for the
                    seamless incorporation of OpenCV into the FRATS website.

                <p class="post-description">In Week 5 of FRATS development, significant progress was made, focusing
                    on
                    crucial functionalities and
                    overcoming challenges. The first day addressed frontend challenges, enhancing responsiveness,
                    and
                    resolving popup confirmation issues. Simultaneously, we successfully tackled image insertion
                    into
                    the
                    SQLite3 database.
                    <br><br>
                    Over the next two days, efforts shifted to optimizing website responsiveness for various
                    devices,
                    ensuring a seamless user experience. We expanded system capabilities by developing a signup and
                    login
                    system.
                    Challenges included communication gaps with Flask for the backend, requiring adjustments to
                    HTML/CSS
                    code. Looking ahead, tasks include consolidating databases, implementing a notification system,
                    and
                    addressing the "Forgot Password" feature.

                <p class="post-description">During the holidays until week 12, I continued with the edits I wanted to
                    make on the FRATS website. I
                    focused on designing the front-end of the website, enhancing the user interface. I made corrections
                    to
                    the HTML, refining the layout to cater to logged-in users. Additionally, I improved the user
                    experience
                    by eliminating the need for users to manually input their names when uploading images. Now, the
                    user's
                    name is automatically saved in the session, and upon login, both the name and image are seamlessly
                    uploaded to the database.
                    <br><br>
                    To enhance the aesthetics of the website, my main focus during week 12 was to continue from where I
                    left
                    off during my holidays. I dedicated my efforts to making the website more user-friendly and visually
                    appealing. Each day, I worked on implementing changes to enhance the overall aesthetics of the
                    website,
                    ensuring it meets both functional and visual expectations. Week 12 involved a continuous refinement
                    process, building on the changes initiated during the holiday period.

                <p class="post-description">
                    In week 13, I continued working on FRATS, shifting my focus to the front-end of the website. I aimed
                    to
                    improve user interaction by adding pop-up messages. Using Flask, HTML, and Bootstrap, I successfully
                    implemented pop-up messages to provide real-time feedback to users. For instance, a green pop-up
                    message
                    indicates a successful image upload, while a brown one signals an issue with incorrect username or
                    password entries. Designing the front-end with these dynamic elements adds a layer of complexity
                    compared to static HTML/CSS/JavaScript, but it significantly enhances the overall user experience.
                    <br><br>
                    During week 13, I had an additional project task involving the design of an attendance sheet. I
                    began by
                    researching various attendance dashboard designs on websites, and I conceptualized a dashboard that
                    showcases employee details such as their company ID/pass, including a picture, name, IC, and other
                    relevant information. The envisioned design allows users to click on their IC/pass softcopy,
                    redirecting
                    them to a page displaying their check-in and check-out times. This project is currently in progress,
                    and
                    I anticipate its completion by the next week, pending the remaining work that needs to be done.

                    a
                    central hub for accessing and reviewing employee attendance records, including daily check-in and
                    check-out times.
                    <br><br>
                    However, the road to implementation wasn't without its roadblocks. Unyielding bugs and errors
                    cropped
                    up, demanding my time and focus to troubleshoot and resolve. While frustrating at times, these
                    challenges presented valuable learning opportunities, deepening my understanding of the codebase and
                    its
                    intricacies.
                    <br><br>
                    Despite the bumps along the way, the potential impact of the attendance dashboard remains a powerful
                    motivator. Once integrated, it will transform administrative tasks, empowering them to effortlessly
                    monitor and manage employee attendance data on a single platform. This centralized approach promises
                    to
                    significantly streamline the process, leading to greater efficiency and improved organizational
                    oversight.
                    <br><br>
                    As Week 14 draws to a close, my unwavering focus remains on refining the code and ensuring a
                    seamless
                    integration of the attendance feature. Debugging complexities are inevitable, but my commitment to
                    this
                    pivotal enhancement remains steadfast. The successful implementation of this feature marks a
                    significant
                    leap forward in website functionality, catering specifically to the needs of administrative users
                    and

                <p class="post-description">
                    During week 15, I devoted considerable effort to advancing the front-end development of our project,
                    particularly focusing on crafting a comprehensive user profile feature within the attendance page.
                    This
                    endeavor centered around designing a visually appealing ID card template that would allow
                    administrators
                    to access a wealth of information about each user with just a click.
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout this process, I immersed myself in the intricacies of the codebase, gradually gaining a
                    deeper understanding of its workings. It became apparent that certain practices I had previously
                    relied
                    on, such as manually managing database connections and cursors, were unnecessary within this
                    context.
                    Moreover, I came to appreciate the importance of promptly committing changes to the database after
                    each
                    insertion—an approach that deviated from my past experiences with MSSQL.
                    <br><br>
                    As I navigated these disparities in practices, I encountered various errors and bugs that tested my
                    problem-solving skills. Among these challenges was the task of rectifying the rotation mechanism for
                    the
                    profile ID cards. Initially, I encountered difficulties in ensuring smooth rotation from the front
                    to
                    the back of the card upon hovering the cursor. However, with perseverance and meticulous debugging
                    efforts, I successfully resolved these issues.
                    <br><br>
                    With the rotation mechanism in place, hovering over the front of the ID card triggers a seamless
                    transition to reveal the back, showcasing additional details such as the employee's bio, employee ID
                    number, department, and the date of issue. Additionally, I incorporated social media links—such as
                    GitHub and LinkedIn—on the back of the card, allowing administrators to explore each user's online
                    profile.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, armed with a comprehensive user profile feature, I am poised to enhance the user experience
                    within
                    the attendance page significantly. Administrators will gain convenient access to a wealth of
                    information
                    about each user, including profile pictures, biographical details, and relevant social media links.
                    This
                    improvement not only streamlines administrative tasks but also fosters a more interactive and
                    engaging
                    platform for users.

                <p class="post-description">
                    As the final week of the PFD project unfolded, excitement crackled in the air. Our tireless efforts
                    finally bore fruit: OpenCV successfully compared images, identifying individuals! This pivotal
                    moment, a
                    testament to our grit and determination, was quickly replaced by the looming deadlines of Week 15.
                    Completing the project within the shrinking timeline and ensuring seamless collaboration felt
                    daunting,
                    but we pivoted swiftly. Prioritization became our mantra, every action guided by the unifying goal
                    of
                    perfect harmony between components.
                    <br><br>
                    My personal front-end journey mirrored this collective effort. The ID card remained unfinished,
                    plagued
                    by alignment issues and a picture display fiasco. Refusing to back down, I sought aid from trusted
                    friends, and together we conquered the challenge. But the quest didn't end there. A crucial employee
                    table demanded creation, showcasing attendance streaks, missed days, and detailed daily check-ins.
                    This
                    intricate task required meticulous attention to detail and strict adherence to project
                    specifications.
                    <br><br>
                    Our path wasn't paved with roses. Presenting attendance data on an HTML page proved trickier than
                    anticipated. Unfamiliarity with concepts like rows, arrays, and Flask initially threw us off
                    balance.
                    Yet, fueled by an unwavering dedication to continuous learning and problem-solving, we emerged
                    triumphant. This was a true reflection of our team's resilience, forged in the fires of each
                    obstacle
                    overcome.
                    <br><br>
                    Bugs, sneaky and ever-present, lurked throughout the project. Just like the extraneous code lurking
                    in
                    the HTML page, sabotaging the login function, they threatened to derail our progress. But by
                    leveraging
                    our honed troubleshooting skills, we met each challenge head-on, ensuring the system's smooth
                    operation.
                    <br><br>
                    Looking back, the PFD experience stands as a beacon of growth and challenge. It was a platform for
                    exploring new technologies, grappling with intricate problems, and acquiring invaluable skills. The
                    inherent difficulties did not deter us; instead, they left a lasting impression, transforming us
                    into a
                    resilient team brimming with knowledge. As the final week draws to a close, we stand united, having
                    conquered every hurdle and built a project that speaks volumes about our dedication and
                    collaborative
                    spirit.
