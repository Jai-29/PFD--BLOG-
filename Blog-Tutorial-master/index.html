                <p class="post-description">In Week 2, our team maintained continuity with the project's initial
                    vision,
                    adapting to the
                    unavailability of a dedicated camera by using laptop or phone cameras temporarily. We
                    established a
                    Git
                    repository for version control and collaborative efficiency.
                    <br><br> As the Front-End Developer, my focus was on creating a foundational HTML website using
                    laptop
                    cameras
                    for image capture. Simultaneously, I delved into extensive research on design aspects, including
                    aesthetic elements, color schemes, and user-friendly features. This thorough exploration ensures
                    our
                    website is not only functional but also visually appealing and intuitive.
                    <br><br>
                    Moving forward, our team is poised for strategic enhancements based on the initial setup. The
                    Git
                    repository will facilitate seamless collaboration, supporting our progress through project
                    stages.
                    The
                    synergy between research, HTML implementation, and ongoing collaboration sets a solid foundation
                    for
                    the
                    success of our Facial Recognition Attendance Taking System, emphasizing our commitment to

                <p class="post-description">In Week 3, as the Front-End Developer for FRATS website development, I
                    focused
                    on creating a visually appealing
                    and user-friendly interface. For the homepage, I crafted a clean design in line with FRATS'
                    identity,
                    utilizing
                    a white space background and the primary color, Purple. The main page design prioritized a
                    seamless
                    and
                    intuitive user experience for capturing and uploading attendance photos. Additionally, I
                    designed a
                    logo
                    featuring a human figure with a fingerprint, symbolizing our biometric focus and security
                    commitment.
                    FRATS aims
                    to offer a contactless, scalable, and affordable AI-powered attendance system. In the coming
                    weeks,
                    I'll

                <p class="post-description">In Week 4 of FRATS development, my primary emphasis was on facilitating
                    image uploads to the SQLite
                    database to seamlessly integrate with OpenCV functionalities. I improved functionality by
                    introducing a
                    new "upload" button and refining user data entry. Dissatisfied with the light theme, I revamped the
                    interface with a sleek black background, a dynamic red-orange color scheme, and an accentuating
                    blue-purplish theme.
                    <br><br>
                    A persistent challenge involves manual image insertion, prompting a renewed commitment to achieving
                    seamless automation for an enhanced user experience and data integrity.
                    <br><br>
                    Moving forward, my development focus will be on addressing this challenge directly, aiming for
                    streamlined automation of image insertion into the SQLite database. Success in this endeavor will be
                    a
                    significant step towards integrating OpenCV into the FRATS website, a crucial milestone in achieving
                    project goals.
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout the ongoing development phase, my commitment remains unwavering in providing detailed
                    explanations, ensuring clarity in the integration of database functionalities, and preparing for the
                    seamless incorporation of OpenCV into the FRATS website.

                <p class="post-description">In Week 5 of FRATS development, significant progress was made, focusing
                    on
                    crucial functionalities and
                    overcoming challenges. The first day addressed frontend challenges, enhancing responsiveness,
                    and
                    resolving popup confirmation issues. Simultaneously, we successfully tackled image insertion
                    into
                    the
                    SQLite3 database.
                    <br><br>
                    Over the next two days, efforts shifted to optimizing website responsiveness for various
                    devices,
                    ensuring a seamless user experience. We expanded system capabilities by developing a signup and
                    login
                    system.
                    Challenges included communication gaps with Flask for the backend, requiring adjustments to
                    HTML/CSS
                    code. Looking ahead, tasks include consolidating databases, implementing a notification system,
                    and
                    addressing the "Forgot Password" feature.
                    <br><br>
                    The team remains dedicated to a meticulous approach, ensuring seamless integration of all FRATS
                    website
                    components. Valuable learning experiences from challenges underscore the collaborative effort

                <p class="post-description">During the holidays until week 12, I continued with the edits I wanted to
                    make on the FRATS website. I
                    focused on designing the front-end of the website, enhancing the user interface. I made corrections
                    to
                    the HTML, refining the layout to cater to logged-in users. Additionally, I improved the user
                    experience
                    by eliminating the need for users to manually input their names when uploading images. Now, the
                    user's
                    name is automatically saved in the session, and upon login, both the name and image are seamlessly
                    uploaded to the database.
                    <br><br>
                    To enhance the aesthetics of the website, my main focus during week 12 was to continue from where I
                    left
                    off during my holidays. I dedicated my efforts to making the website more user-friendly and visually
                    appealing. Each day, I worked on implementing changes to enhance the overall aesthetics of the
                    website,
                    ensuring it meets both functional and visual expectations. Week 12 involved a continuous refinement
                    process, building on the changes initiated during the holiday period.

                <p class="post-description">
                    In week 13, I continued working on FRATS, shifting my focus to the front-end of the website. I aimed
                    to
                    improve user interaction by adding pop-up messages. Using Flask, HTML, and Bootstrap, I successfully
                    implemented pop-up messages to provide real-time feedback to users. For instance, a green pop-up
                    message
                    indicates a successful image upload, while a brown one signals an issue with incorrect username or
                    password entries. Designing the front-end with these dynamic elements adds a layer of complexity
                    compared to static HTML/CSS/JavaScript, but it significantly enhances the overall user experience.
                    <br><br>
                    During week 13, I had an additional project task involving the design of an attendance sheet. I
                    began by
                    researching various attendance dashboard designs on websites, and I conceptualized a dashboard that
                    showcases employee details such as their company ID/pass, including a picture, name, IC, and other
                    relevant information. The envisioned design allows users to click on their IC/pass softcopy,
                    redirecting
                    them to a page displaying their check-in and check-out times. This project is currently in progress,
                    and
                    I anticipate its completion by the next week, pending the remaining work that needs to be done.

                    I thrive in blending creativity with functionality, be it designing logos for
                    SpiritFox or revamping websites for FRATS and CBRE. Rooted in core values,
                    I'm driven by a passion for authentic design and believe in meaningful connections,
                    metaphysical tranquility, and profound engagement with the universe.</p>
